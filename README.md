# Smart-Sailor


The goal of the Smart Sailor project is to develop a situational awareness platform and collision avoidance algorithms for Åboat which is an autonomous and remote-controlled research boat platform being developed by the IT department at Åbo Akademi. Currently, we are using the simulated version of Åboat to build our system in AILiveSim. To develop situational awareness, we are combining lidar data with camera images to determine the precise distance of nearby objects. By implementing reinforcement learning on the AiLiveSim data, we are planning to build the collision avoidance algorithm.
